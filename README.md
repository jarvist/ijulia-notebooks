# ijulia-notebooks

These are Jarvist Moore Frost's public iJulia Jupyter notebooks. 

Some of these were published to illustrate a point in a blogpost; others as the simplest way to share a bit of 'workings' with a collaborator; some as trivial little micro notebooks to show something vaguely interesting / useful. 

This is actually a subfolder in my main Notebook folder. The day-to-day (much more messy! there's hundreds of them!) notebooks are internally shared between laptops + desktops via a private git repository on BitBucket.

Please do have a look in GitHub, or use the NBViewer interface (this has a better chance of loading the figures):
